A graph is a data structure made of nodes connected to other nodes.
Unlike trees, graphs can form cycles.

## Graph Terminology
- Node/Vertex: An object that stores data and links to child nodes/vertices.
- Edge: A link between two nodes.
- Adjacent nodes: Two nodes connected by an edge.
- Directed graphs: Edges in directed graphs only point in one direction.
- Undirected graphs: Edges in undirected graphs point both ways.

## Graph Representation
In code, there are two main ways of representing graphs.
Graphs can be represented as adjacency lists or adjacency matrices.

### Adjacency List
In an adjacency list, the graph is stored as a list of nodes.
Each individual node contains a list of its adjacent nodes. 

### Adjacency Matrix
In an adjacency matrix, the graph is represented as a 2D array of boolean values.
If \\(graph[i][j] == true\\), then node \\(i\\) has an edge to node \\(j\\).
