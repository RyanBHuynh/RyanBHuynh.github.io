title: Big O Notation
---

Big O (big-oh) notation gives computer scientists a way to show how complex an algorithm is.

## Basics of Big O
Big O notation can be used to show how much time it takes to run a program, as well as how much space the program takes up.  
You can use Big O to compare programs no matter what programming language they were written in or what machine the program runs on.

### Example Complexities
Below is a list of example runtimes:

| Runtime        | Big O Notation  | Example Algorithm             |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| Constant time  | \\(O(1)\\)      | Accessing an array element    |
| Linear time    | \\(O(n)\\)      | Finding the sum of an array   |
| Quadratic time | \\(O(n^2)\\)    | Finding the sum of a 2D array |
