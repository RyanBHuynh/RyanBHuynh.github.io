Hi there!

I'm Ryan Huynh, a student at the University of Missouri. I'm majoring in computer science. 
Here is where I plan on writing introductions to computer science concepts and hosting personal projects.

In my free time, I enjoy running, reading, learning new languages, and hanging out with others.
